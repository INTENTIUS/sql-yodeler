/**
 * Fills events.country, one month of events per batch. Each batch is an
 * effect() with its own receipt, so a run that stops part way resumes at the
 * first month without one. The UPDATE touches only rows still empty, so a
 * batch that ran half way can run again.
 *
 * yodel new --backfill copies this file into the migration's directory as
 * backfill.ts; that copy is the one yodel apply runs, and it counts in the
 * migration's checksum.
